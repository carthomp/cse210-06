# Space Invaders

Space Invaders is our take on a Python version of Galaga and similar games. Control a spaceship and take down hostile aliens - but don't let them damage your ship!

## Getting Started

---

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.

```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```

After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

```
python3 space_invaders
```

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure

---

The project files and folders are organized as follows:

```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- space_invaders               (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
+-- __main__.py         (entry point for program)
+-- constants.py        (constant values used throughout the program files - modify them at your own risk)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
